## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I learned how to use the React hooks : useState, useRef, useEffect.

----------
Components
----------
1. navbar : Used useEffect hook to create a toggle effect to open the sidebar.
2. sidebar : Used useEffect hook to close the sidebar after being opened by the button in navbar
3. form : Used callback function and prop drilling to update the cartDisplay number of orders
